                <header><h3>JavaScript</h3></header>
                
                <p>This is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.</p>
                <p>This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.</p>
                <p>The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to the latest draft version, which is currently ECMAScript 2020.</p>
                <p>Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and uses.</p>

                <p>Learn how to program in JavaScript with guides and tutorials.</p>
                <p>For complete beginners, you can start with the <p>Hello World Alert in JavaScript: <code>alert( 'Hello, world!' )</code></p>This must be withing the script tag. We can also pass it in the console<p><code>console.log("Hello, World!");</code></p></p>
                <p><h4>Prompting for Input</h4>Every time we run our existing “Hello, World!” program, it produces the same output. Let’s prompt the person running our program for their name. We can then use that name to customize the output.</p>
                <p>For each of our JavaScript methods we used above, we can begin with one line prompting for input. We’ll use JavaScript’s prompt() method, and pass to it the string "What is your name?" to ask the user for their name. The input that is entered by the user will then be stored in the variable name. We’ll end our expression with a semicolon.</p>
                <p>Head over to our Learning Area JavaScript topic if you want to learn JavaScript but have no previous experience of JavaScript or programming. The complete modules available there are as follows:</p>
                <p>JavaScript first steps. Answers some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can it do?", along with discussing key JavaScript features such as variables, strings, numbers, and arrays.</p>
                <p>JavaScript building blocks. Continues our coverage of JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events.</p>
